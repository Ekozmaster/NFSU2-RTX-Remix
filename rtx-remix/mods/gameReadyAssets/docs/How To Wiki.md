Most tips taken from GDD guides like [Nuclino's](https://www.nuclino.com/articles/write-game-design-document)

### Weaknesses
- _"No one reads Wikis anyway."_
- _"They become outdated the minute you write them."_
- _"Where is x described? Is it in the wiki? Won't bother searching for it..."_

### Rule #1: It is not MS Word
Resist the urge to write lengthy, strict, highly detailed text walls. Everyone loves simple, short, objective and open minded concepts in which they feel comfortable to contribute.

### Rule #2: Keep it Collaborative
No wiki replaces internal discussion. This wiki will be rewritten through the entire life of this project. Let it grow organically, leaving open spaces for collaboration, gathering feedbacks and discussing issues with the team.

### Rule #3: Make it VISUAL
_"A picture is worth a thousand words"_
_"Show, Don't tell"_
Can you organize and explain your ideas with effective images, examples or references?
Can you break your ideas down into multiple notes/.md files and link them all for easier focus and navigation as an Obsidian graph/mental map?
